# Exploratory Data Analysis

This is my first attempt at doing any data analysis using coding; the goal is to uncover patterns, relationships and anomolies in the data; with hopes of helping the business to make more informed decisions

To install the project; you'll need the necessary credentials which, of course, aren't public and then just follow the normal git procedure

To use the project, currently use data_viewer.py and add any functions you'll need and then you add any functions you want added.

As the data isn't real, there's no data protection issues so don't worry about that.
